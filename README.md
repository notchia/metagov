# Metagov data analysis projects

## Demonstrate Airtable API use and conduct preliminary analysis

## Find governance-related parameters in, e.g., the [Gnosis Safe contract](https://github.com/gnosis/safe-contracts/blob/main/contracts/GnosisSafe.sol)
From the contract text, identify parameters and their contexts (description and function for which each is defined), then find parameters which may be related to governance by defining keywords and searching for these within the parameter descriptions.

## Analyze Cryptogov survey results
